# transition_aware_bt
An adaptive and transition-aware beam tracking framework that dynamically adjusts sweeping frequency according to both receiver speed and predicted LOS/NLOS transitions. Four hierarchical strategies are developed: the fixed- interval Reuse Strategy (RS), its transition-aware variant (HRS), the Adaptive RS (ARS) and the AHRS.
