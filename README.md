Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications are essential to 5G-Advanced and 6G systems, yet they remain highly vulnerable to user mobility and line-of-sight (LOS) blockages.  Conventional beam management as defined in 3GPP TS~38.211–214 relies on fixed-period sweeping of Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB) or Channel State Information Reference Signals (CSI-RS), which becomes inefficient under varying mobility and propagation dynamics.  
This paper proposes an adaptive and transition-aware beam tracking framework that dynamically adjusts sweeping frequency according to both receiver speed and predicted LOS/NLOS transitions.  Four hierarchical strategies are developed: the fixed-interval Reuse Strategy (RS), its transition-aware variant (HRS), the Adaptive Reuse Strategy (ARS) driven by a coherence-time-based physical model, and the Adaptive Hybrid Reuse Strategy (AHRS). The framework is evaluated on synthetic ray-tracing datasets and the real-world DeepSense~6G scenario. Results show that ARS and AHRS maintain accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning baselines, such as DeepBT and GRU predictors, while reducing beam-sweeping overhead by up to 78\%.  
A new composite score based on the Utopia-Distance principle is introduced to jointly assess accuracy and efficiency, revealing that the proposed adaptive strategies consistently occupy the Pareto-optimal region across datasets. The findings demonstrate that learning-driven adaptation aligned with 3GPP mobility classes provides a scalable path to efficient beam management in next-generation wireless networks.
